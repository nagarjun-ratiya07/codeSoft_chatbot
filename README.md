In this project, you'll build a basic chatbot in Python! It'll chat with users by understanding what they type. Like a simple conversation partner, it can respond to greetings, answer questions about itself, tell jokes, and even check the weather (based on what you tell it to do). The chatbot figures out what to say by looking for keywords in what the user types. The code uses regular Python functions to get what the user types, decide what to say based on that, and then give a reply. You can chat with this chatbot as long as you want, but it will say goodbye when you type "bye."
